415,"does the president believe. that was frustrating to reporters, who think that there ought to be a simple answer about where does the president stand right now. if he says that he embraces climate change differently, of course that raises lots of other political questions, alex. and if he says he still thinks"
416,"they're still out here as you can see getting loud and getting proud on the issues that they care about. inside it's a little bit more subdued. he is taking a lot of questions on health care, immigration, climate change. there was a one notable moment, however, when a woman who asked"
417,"walked down the road and got a little wet, he would convert and understand that climate change is real because we believe it in miami beach. the mayors across the country do believe that. you've got evidence there so what kind of changes have you made in your city to protect it"
418,"reception at 10 downing street, the prime minister's residence and from the prime minister herself and her government. but beyond that, not quite so welcoming. he is a very divisive figure in this country and throughout europe because of his stance on nature together, on climate change. and so many other issues."
419,"we all have to step up on. it's also a real question of public health and clean air and clean water. i don't see how any of that can be partisan. the other thing that's a baseline is believing whether or not climate change is real or a hoax, and we don't really have a"
420,"to europe and the rest of the world ultimately could have a significant negative impact on our trade balance. why do you think, though, it was the u.n. ambassador that could give one of the more direct answers, an almost affirmative answer about climate change and the president's feelings on it, when we can't"
421,the majority of republican voters who want to see action on climate change. the real partisan divide is the republican politicians who have been paid by fossil fuel industry to absolutely deny what for this country is the single biggest opportunity to generate we wealth in the 21st century. we invented solar in this
422,but it's certainly not the grand agenda they were looking for. obviously they're pulling back things from the obama years as well. whether it be on dodd/frank or climate change and epa. that's what the celebration is going to be for the trump years. when you were on the air this
423,"it was interesting. he went out of his way to express nothing but positive feelings about president trump, no matter all the differences they have on issues like trade, climate change, and other things. he had throughout the course of our hour interview on stage at the rotman school here, he was"
424,"presidential decision on climate change, dan rather stop join my colleague lawrence o'donnell in the next hour. dan rather of course has been one of the sharpest critics of this white house on so many issues. so you may want to hear his first-time reaction to this big decision on paris and where we"
425,"moving forward and then that all-important question that you started the segment with. does the president still think climate change is a hoax? is it something that he said a while ago. he sort of softened that language. where does he stand right now? it is a central question to this debate, hallie."
426,of his time. he lined up support for bringing the president along to his side of the debate on climate change. some have suggested that that's where the president always was. but i wonder if you could give us the current state of play inside this white house's ongoing and very public power
427,"weather. i am not a believer in man-made climate change. i am not a great believer. i believe strongly in clean water and clean air. but i don't believe that what they say, i think it is a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money."
428,"lawyers, can the new war room really keep the russia controversy from infecting the rest of the trump administration? also, why is the white house refusing to say whether president trump believes in climate change or not? we're going to talk about that and more with the one and only sir richard branson."
429,"people think something is going on. for example, there is a good poll out that came out a few months ago where people felt concerned about climate change, but only 27 or 20% wanted to actually do anything about it, like a cap and trade or some other kind of drastic measure."
430,"if we don't do something about it. well, i suspect if president trump were here -- and by the way, we can't get out of the white house whether he believes in climate change or not. but if he were here, he would say this, is that he was elected by the population of the united"
431,the paris climate agreement. we learned today what also annoyed him was that tight handshake he got from the new french president at the g7 summit. and top white house officials still won't say whether trump even believes in climate change. how does it even matter what he believes when he's doing is what
432,"one day after the decision to pull america out of the paris climate agreement, why can't top white house officials answer the simple question? well, it is maybe a science. does trump believe in climate change or not? it's a fair question. today in the press room they kept asking it and all they got"
433,"administrator, the guy you think would know, said he's never discussed the issue with the president. believe it or not, here it is. you're the epa administrator. shouldn't you be able to tell the american people whether or not the president still believes that climate change is a hoax. where does he stand?"
434,"i think he believes that it is -- first of all, even though the epa and his team wouldn't answer that question today on if he believes climate change is a hoax, if you just look at his twitter feed or his past statements, he said that repeatedly. i'm his age and i've noticed"
435,the u.s. would have a seat at the table when it comes to all important long range climate change talks. we have been getting diverging reports what exactly president trump will decide to do. some white house sources say he plans to leave this accord and the language around it is all that's left out.
436,"line except for american workers and that's what trump has made clear his interest is in the american economy and american workers. bill nye, you don't have to be a climate change denier to say maybe the paris agreement doesn't work for us. why is it so important for us to stay in?"
437,"whatever the united states decides,t will go ahead and the european union praising the chinese. remember, it's not that long ago that the chinese were the climate change deniers. yeah. and they switched and now they're in a position of global leadership and as mitt romney said yesterday, this isn't just"
438,"deals, or the america first idea, he will play to the idea that whatever we do on climate change. i don't think he'll say that it exists. i don't think he will say it is bad to cut emissions. i think he has to say it is our choice. one way or the other --  _"
439,"he's always thought climate change is a hoax. anything the previous administration has done, he's out to destroy. anything basic global treaty goes against him. i said before, this is the first president in my lifetime, say, possibly, richard nixon, and george w. bush i disagree with, but he like clinton, like obama,"
440,what stuck with me about this message was the fact he was really contrasting. he said paris or pittsburgh. this idea was that these two cities are now somehow at war and that if we care about climate change and we think about the climate and we think about how we're going to lower
441,"key issue. is paris good or bad for this country? shouldn't you be able to tell the american people whether or not the president still believes that climate change is a hoax? where does he stand? as i indicated several times through the process, there's enough to deal with with respect to the paris agreement and"
442,"last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue, is paris good or not for this country. i would like to go back to the first question that was asked that you didn't answer. does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax? you know, i did answer the question because i said the"
443,"you for example it's interesting about all the discussions we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue, is paris good or not for this country. i would like to go back to the first question that was asked that you didn't answer. does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax?"
444,"in climate change or not. whher he believes it's real or not. well, today his epa administrator, the guy you think would know, said he's never discussed the issue with the president. believe it or not, here it is. you're the epa administrator. shouldn't you be able to tell the american people whether or not the president still believes"
445,"that climate change is a hoax. where does he stand? there's enough to deal with, with respect to the paris agreement and making an informed decision about this important issue. that's what our focus has been over the last several weeks. joining me right now is ashley parker, reporter for 'the washington post,' and author of"
446,"about something regarding climate change. there's been so much question as to whether or not the president actually believes in it. you've probably seen the back and forth. there were three, if not more reporters in the white house press briefing that were trying to press not only scott pruitt, epa head, but also sean spicer."
447,"on climate change, saying that he represents the people of pittsburgh, not paris. they've sort of embraced that line as their own. also wanting to turn out to show up to counter some of the protests that have been a regular part of these months of the trump administration to show that there are supporters of the"
448,"2016. he's going to be heavily challenged again in 2018. but you know, he came to this town meeting, he listened to people's concerns about health care, about the environment, about climate change. and he talked to reporters. i had a good interview with him and talked to him about what it's like for him as a"
449,"concerns by arguing that the republicans had eliminated themselves from contention in the general election because of their approach during the campaign on issues such as climate change. do you now regret not making this treaty ratified in the united states senate, forcing it to be codified here? no. really i'm not. it wouldn't have happened. that's very simple."
450,"i understand. the majority of americans support climate change and staying in paris. i know. but as you understand, there is a political divide. and the president does feel politically secure with his base that they're comfortable with this decision. it tells me that your message hasn't penetrated essentially red america. why? well, because there's an"
451,"day from filling potholes to fighting crime, from dealing with climate change and doing basic things like picking up trash, and we live in real-time in reality. people who are just trying to get to, who, get to the little league with their kids, are focused on all of those things, plus the russia investigation."
452,"the press secretary has said he has not spoken with the president about it. it's been five months, this is an answer we heard before from sean spicer, i think about climate change, i think about the idea whether the president has seen a draft of the health care bill. these were all in the last 48"
453,"climate change, i'm going to listen to bannon because i'm be going to be pushed around by my kids. you are dealing with a guy so into himself that he is going to always affirm that i'm in charge here. even if he is charging the nation the wrong way. here's what i'm trying to figure out."
454,"feel it is a no brainer. on both sides of the aisle. you see the younger people said hey, the republican party needs to get more progressive on climate change. but u have people from, it is the same base of trump voters that we spent so much time talking about. the public party is really"
455,"it seems like they're afraid of what they're going to hear and what's going to come out. but it does seem like if you're going to make all these decisions, like the american people would need to know do you believe in climate change because if not, why continue doing these negotiations? why even think about carbon."
456,"turn the page on the russia story, as john says, this is something where they're choosing not to answer a lot of these questions. sean spicer continues to say, i haven't talked to the president about whether or not he actually believes in climate change, but i will. well, week after week, he still hasn't talked to him, right?"
457,"gets that accomplished in a real way, not just a symbolic way. what does that mean in concrete terms? we have to go somewhere from here, where do we go? what does the president do if he makes clear where he's standing on climate change pulls out of the deal allies are upset, what's the path you see forward?"
458,"were -- elon musk tweeted, you just mentioned him, he tweeted he's departing the presidential council. climate change is real, leaving the paris accord is not good for america or the world. so there you have it. this is a guy who's run a company that has to do business in america and the rest of the"
459,"we do have an all of the above. people need to understand that an all of the above is important. so does all the above mean the president can say to me i believe in climate change and at a rally he doesn't? is that what all of the above means? no. i'm telling you, if you"
460,president at the g7 summit. and top white house officials still won't say whether trump even believes in climate change. how does it even matter what he believes when he's doing is what is political for him? the 'hardball' roundtable looks at next week the testimony of fired fbi director james comey. we're going to find out what he's got on trump.
461,"don't get his call-back slips. one day after the decision to pull america out of the paris climate agreement, why can't top white house officials answer the simple question? well, it is maybe a science. does trump believe in climate change or not? it's a fair question. today in the press room they kept asking it and all they got"

468,sean spicer continues to say i haven't talked to the president about whether or not he actually believes in climate change. but i will. well week after week he hasn't talked to him. it's not that long a path from his office back to the oval. yet somehow he can't come up with the answer. they can't say whether there is
469,"question. but if he does believe in it, the science of it, then what's to negotiate? that's the number one question. but i think the idea that the white house won't say whether or not he doesn't agree with climate change, of course it's something that has been proven by scientists, but if you have to have that conversation, then"
470,"country? that's the discussions i've had with the president. i'd like to go back to the first question that was asked that you didn't answer. does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax? you know, i did answer the question because i said the discussions the president and i had had over the last several weeks have been focused on one"
471,i'm not for either one of those. i don't think it's stark to fight that. i think it's wonderfully positive. i think there are a lot of americans like myself across this country who believe we can be much smarter in how we approach these things than president obama was. do you think -- do you believe in climate change? i believe that the climate

474,"day, what just happened? what did he do today. essentially, what he did today. i think it's fair to level the critique what he did was changed the nature of america's relationship with the rest of the word. for years -- other than that. let's jump into it. essentially, for years, republicans opposed climate change legislation by saying, hey, look, american can't act unilaterally, china may need to be constrained as well if we are"
475,you're dismissing actually the majority of republican voters. i agree. that. they do want to see action on climate change. the real partisan divide is the republican politicians who have been paid by fossil fuel industry to absolutely deny what for this country is the single biggest opportunity to generate we wealth in the 21st century. we invented solar in this country. now we're at risk of seeing china be the one to give its people tens of millions of green jobs. both sides have some problems here.
476,the guy living in the residence portion of this building we're just not having that conversation -- and by the way what do you hear about spicer and his job. i suppose they can because they are. unless there is a big enough public outcry it's not just not being able to turn the page on the rather than story. as john says this is something they can't even -- they're choosing not to answer a lot of the questions. sean spicer continues to say i haven't talked to the president about whether or not he actually believes in climate change. but i will. well week after week he hasn't talked to him.

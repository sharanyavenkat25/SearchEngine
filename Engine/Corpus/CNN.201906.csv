452,he's constitutionally opposed to telling the truth in a loyal way and i think he doesn't know the facts. another example is when he was talking about climate change. first off all he said america has the cleanest climate. the environment can be clean or
453,prince charles very much of the view that climate change is a threat to humanity. president trump often refers to it as just extreme weather. this is what he told piers morgan. i believe that there is a change in weather and i think it
454,throw in there and you would agree with me. he introduced a new plan to battle climate change calling for $1.7 trillion in federal spending with a goal of net zero greenhouse emissions. a bold plan. you know a lot about it.
455,"if he believes in climate change, he said, there's a change in the weather, but sometimes it changes one way -- it goes both ways. yeah, this is completely contrary to what all leading climate scientists say. it goes completely against science. that should be clear."
456,"they take massive amounts of drugs. they have to, and also -- and you're not allowed to take drugs. you know, in the military, you're not allowed to take any drugs. reporter: mr. trump was also back to denying climate change, something the scientific community believes is happening."

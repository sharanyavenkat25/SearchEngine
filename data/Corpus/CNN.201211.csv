1,i almost called you rob marciano but let's move on. new york mayor bloomberg talks about global warming and
2,michael bloomberg saying the same thing. i think it has got ten worse. we are in big trouble and in congress whether or not there is global warming.
3,he believe very fill firmly it is about global warming and it will get worse. what do you think? i think it has gotten worse. i think we are way down the road here. we're in pretty big trouble and we're still having a debate in congress whether or not there is global warming.
